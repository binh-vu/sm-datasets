In 1974, Nancy Andreasen from the University of Iowa studied 30 faculty members attending a writers? workshop and matched them with 30 controls. She found that 80% of participating writers suffered from depression or bipolar disorder, compared to 30% of her controls.   a) Studying Creative Individuals Eminent historical individuals have been studied by researching their biographies to see what percentage of them have psychiatric illnesses.
